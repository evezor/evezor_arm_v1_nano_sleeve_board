# evezor_arm_v1_nano_sleeve_board

This board was intended to sit at the elbow of the robotic arm and its primary function was to obtain and smooth readings from the encoders and to drive the neopixel arrays at each joint. 

It also featured 2 ide ports that followed the Gadgeteer standard which I found to be a less than satisfactory attempt at creating modular systems. More on these reasonings can be found in some of my other posts.
